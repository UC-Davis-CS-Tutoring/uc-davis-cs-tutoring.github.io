        <h1>UC Davis CS Tutoring</h1>
        <h2>A free, peer-run service for UC Davis students.</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to CS Peer Tutoring! Every quarter, the CS Tutoring
            Committee organizes undergraduate volunteer tutors to help students
            with undergraduate CS courses. All tutors are approved by the CS
            department, and received high grades in the courses they tutor.
        </p>
        <p>
            CS tutoring is free for all students --- just head down to Kemper
            75 (in the basement of Kemper Hall, look for signs pointing to the
            CSIF) at one of the times shown below and sign in on the whiteboard.
        </p>
